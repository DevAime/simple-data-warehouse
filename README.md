Simple Data Warehouse with Python, SQLite, and Pandas

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build a simple data warehouse using SQLite for storage and Pandas for data manipulation.
It also includes functions for data visualization (via Matplotlib & Seaborn) and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).

🚀 Features

Create and connect to an SQLite database

Execute SQL queries

Fetch and display data from the database

Create tables directly from Pandas DataFrames

Perform basic exploratory data analysis

Visualize data using bar, line, and scatter plots

🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter


SQLite3 comes bundled with Python by default.

▶️ Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook data_warehouse.ipynb


Run the cells step by step. The notebook will:

Create a database (data_warehouse.db)

Insert a sample employee dataset into a table

Fetch and display stored records

Perform basic analysis (head, info, summary, missing values)

Generate a bar chart of employee salaries
